# Website for the Purple Hat Project Made during the Codevengers Hackathon 2022

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That's this file.

← `index.html`: This is the main web page for the site. The HTML defines the structure and content of the page using _elements_. You'll see references in the HTML to the JS and CSS files.

← `style.css`: CSS files add styling rules to the content. The CSS applies styles to the elements in your HTML page. 

← `script.js`: Adds interactivity to the site with JavaScript. The code in the JavaScript file runs when the page loads.
